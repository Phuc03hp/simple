# Post Management

- Task Completed:
+ Responsive design
+ API method: get, post, put, delete.
+ Basic functions: Get data by param, id. Add new post. Edit post. Delete Post
+ Well work: <PostCardList> and <PostCard> with get method.

- Problem remain:
+ The Add, Edit, Delete Button : should be in one Component?
+ The PostForm component (Bad code): Should it be two different component for add/edit function?
+ Render problem: The PostCardList is not rendered after Add/Edit/Delete action. (try using callback to the custom hook usePost() but feel not right)
+ useContext: Not sure placing in right place.
